    <CENTER><i><b><p555> Ever since the Star-Spangled was made official, it has united our nation, and has created a great amount of respect amongst our nation’s people. It has unified our nation so much, that if a person does not sing the National Anthem when a flag is being raised, they will go through a lot of pressure and criticism from the nation’s people. There have not been any violent riots due to this unsaid rule in society, but there have been protests and disrespect to the national anthem. Below are two cases, the ‘Black Power Salute’ in the 1968 Olympics, and a recent issue regarding the stance of NFL Quarterback, Colin Kaepernick. </p555></b></i></CENTER>

    <b><i><CENTER><p5>1998 Black Power Salute</p5></CENTER></i></b>
    <bR>
    <CENTER><p55>During the medal cermony in the 1998 Summer Olympics, when the Star-Spangled Banner was being played, American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos, raised their left black fists (considered a “Black Power” Salute). The world didn't know how to respond to this, especially America. Of course many American citizens felt angry and upset, causing the International Olympic Committee to reconsider the the athletes’ highly-respected position as some of the USA's top athletes.  At first the US Olympic Committee refused to expel these two athletes, but after a threat of eliminating the entire track team from the International Olympic Committee, they succumbed, and let Smith and Carlos go. Smith and Carlos claimed that this action was purely for human rights, as for all three athletes present on the olympic pedestals wore human rights badges, but the nation misunderstood it for a racial protest. Only after 40 years, had the nation realized their big proclamation without reason. By then it was too late to accept the two athletes back into the Olympics. After realizing their mistake, the nation profusely apologized to the athletes and their families. There were also multiple memorials and ceremonies were made and held. In the end the nation was never redeemed for their doing, but were let with an approval of their apology. This incident shows how powerful just one small difference in the presence of the National Anthem, can create non-existing issues. </p55></CENTER><br>

    <p55><center>In 2008, the grandson of Peter Norman, the third athlete present at the pedestals, during the 'Black Power Salute', made a movie based off of the 1968 Olympics. Peter Norman, who supported this "Fist raise", was deeply critisized for his actions, especially since he supported two blackmen. Segregation had started to end a couple years before, but not everyone adjusted to it, and did not appreciate black people for who they are. Peter Norman supported these men, until he passed away in early October of 2006. Tommie Smith and John Carlos were pallbearers, and held their respect for Norman, who had a strong stance by his beleif of Human rights. This movie was to created to show how Norman had been affected by this case, and how he din't let an angry nation decieve him of his true beleifs and thought.</center></p55>

    <b><i><CENTER><p5>2016  NFL Quarterback~Colin Kaepernick </p5></CENTER></i></b>
    <br>
    <CENTER><p55>On August 26, 2016, NFL Quarterback Colin Kaepernick was noticed to be sitting while the national anthem was being played. Again, like the 1998 Incident, where two athletes went out of order in front of the National Anthem, Kaepernick was criticized and shamed. Not only had Kaepernick sat out for this National but, a couple others ranging in between August 14 and August 20.  This caused the nation to rage in anger, and consider this as his protest towards the Anthem. Kaepernick said his doings were for the people who had no voice in the nation, and he had hoped to gain attention for those people, by being noticed by the nation/press. He made it clear in an interview that this was for no protest but to focus on the social issue of the nation. He said;
    <br>
    <br>
    "I have great respect for the men and women that have fought for this country. I have family, I have friends that have gone and fought for this country. And they fight for freedom, they fight for the people, they fight for liberty and justice, for everyone. That’s not happening. People are dying in vain because this country isn’t holding their end of the bargain up, as far as giving freedom and justice, liberty to everybody. That’s something that’s not happening, and that is not right.”
    <br>
    <br>
    Like 12 years ago, part of the nation apologized for their ‘misjudgment’, but in just a couple of months. Some people still have a different opinion on this situation, but that is only due to the respect they have for the American National Anthem.</p55></CENTER><br>
