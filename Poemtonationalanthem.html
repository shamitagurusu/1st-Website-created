  <p4>The first time the ‘Defence of Fort McHenry’ was taken to be turned into a patriotic song was in 1889,  and it was made official for the United States Navy. Although Francis Scott Key’s poem was turned into an official ‘anthem’ for the U.S. Navy, it was not official for the nation until 1931, when congress had finally approved. After congress passed this proposal in 1931, President Herbert Hoover signed. Before congress had passed in 1931, John Charles Lithium, U.S. Congressman from Maryland, tried to make it official in 1916, but failed to do so. After made official, the ‘Star-Spangled Banner’ became a widely known and well-played piece to be played at all sorts of events. </p4>
<br>
<br>
<p4>Before 1931, Francis Scott Key’s poem was put in with the rhythm of many other songs, such as “Hail Columbia”, and "My Country, Tis of Thee". In 1889, the secretary of the U.S. Navy, Benjamin F. Tracy, made the ‘Star-Spangled Banner’ the official song that played at every flag raising in the Navy. He did this by signing General Order#347. Later, in 1916, President Woodrow Wilson demanded that the ‘Star-Spangled Banner’ had to be played in the military and other important places/occasions. One of the first major events the star-Spangled Banner was played in was the 1918 World Series. From then on, most of the major international and national sport events sang the ‘Star-Spangled Banner’, before playing.</p4>
<br>
<br>
<p4>Nowadays, the United States government has made it mandatory for all present when the flag is raised, to stand with their right hands over their heart and sing the National Anthem. Also, individuals in uniform should give the military salute at the first note of the anthem and maintain that position until the last note; and when the flag is not displayed, all present should face toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed. Military law requires all vehicles to stop when the song is played, and all individuals outside to stand at attention and face the direction of the music and either salute, in uniform, or place the right hand over the heart. These requirements fall under various approved codes and laws which confirm the being of the people near a U.S. flag when it is being raised.</p4>
