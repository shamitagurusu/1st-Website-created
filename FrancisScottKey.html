   <p2>Francis Scott Key was a proud American lawyer. He was born on his family plantation in present day Carroll County, Maryland. He was a third generation immigrant from great Britain, and had a family who believed in justification and law. With a father who once belonged to the Continental Army, Key was bound to be a highly-respected attorney at court. Key ended up growing into a kind and successful man, helping his family and friends justify with the law any way he could.</p2>
   <br>
   <br>
   <p2> In September of 1814, while the 1812 war was still going on, Key made a daring move to negotiate with three British Officers for the return of his friend, Dr. William Beanes. He was aboard the ship, a couple mile of the shore of Baltimore, when the attack on Fort Henry had taken place. He watched from a distance as red flames had lit up the harbor, and could only imagine what the American army had been feeling. By the middle of the night, where most Americans lay dead and dying on the battleground, Key was sure the British were going to win. With no hope Key turned his back to supress any shameful feelings towards the nation. He felt dismayed and unjustified, so the next morning when Key saw a large American flag perched on top of Fort McHenry, you could only imagine the tremendous patriotic feelings Key felt for his country. With nowhere but paper to put down his feelings, Key wrote a poem. He called the poem 'Defence of Fort McHenry', which later became known to the world as the lyrics of the Star-Spangled Banner,(The American National Anthem).</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p2>A few years after Key had wrote 'The Defence of Fort McHenry', he started to grow into an anti-abolitionist. He owned six slaves, all in which he had found great use for, and did everything in his willpower to deteriorate abolitionists in court. Keys took his belief to such an extent as to where he agreed to prosecute botanist and doctor, Reuben Crandall. He found out that Crandall had a trunk full of anti-slavery publications in his Georgetown residence, a couple days after a rumored Slave riot. In an April 1837 trial, Crandall was found “guilty” and prosecuted. This had been Key’s last major case, before Key retired in 1840. He continued to be an anti-abolitionist, and continued to criticize slaves, but hadn’t known that 91 years from now, his poem, 'The Defence of Fort McHenry' would be the nation’s ort of pride and comfort.</p2>
