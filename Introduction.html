  <p>James Madison flees the burning Capital City as the British take over, bringing down all monumental and important governmental buildings. Madison and a few others, including his army, roam around fearfully, trying to find refuge in small unsuspecting towns. After a countless number of hours, Madison takes refuge in Brookville, a small town located off the border of Maryland. With no power over the capital, all Madison can do is hope for the best, as the it is seized by the British. Back at the capital the British have finished burning down the capitol, and feel pride take over, as their revenge turns out to be successful. After the Americans had seized, tortured, and burned down Port Dover, the british gre an uncanny thirst for revenge.

  <div class="p1">
  <p1><b>September 13, 1814</b></p1>
  <p>A month after the American capital had been burned down, the British make their way towards the Baltimore harbor, their motive being quite clear. At this point of the 1812 war, the British had gone far over mad, and were willing to do almost anything to win. Ever since, America had interfered with their trade with France, the British had a longing to take down American trade. In order to do so, they needed to conquer Baltimore, one of Americaâ€™s main trading hubs. To destroy the Americans further more, they had to take down fort McHenry, which had been the source of protection for Baltimore. They swept over Baltimore as if they had owned the city, killing anyone and everyone in their way. It had seemed as though Baltimore had been swallowed by a red ocean, with the uniforms of the British and blood of the Americans being indistinguishable. Although at disadvantage, the brave American army fought with all their might against the revenge-seeking British. As the first half of the battle took place, smoke polluted the air, as ashes rained down and over Fort McHenry. The British had been sure that they were going to win, but in the remaining half of the battle the Americans proved themselves to be worthy. Now, instead of surrender from the Americans, it was the British who were running for their lives. As the smoke cleared the next morning, a large American flag was perched on top of the fort, signaling the hard-earned victory of the Americans. American bypassers, who had watched the battle take place, had overwhelming sense of patriotism towards their nation. One passerby, Francis Scott Keys was filled with so much pride that he wrote a poem. This poem had been called the 'Defence of Fort McHenry', which would later be known to the world as the proud American National Anthem.
